# Packaging and Distribution Lesson

This repository contains a lesson on software packaging and distribution, based in Python.

It was initially written by Henry Schreiner and Kyle Niemeyer during the [INTERSECT RSE Workshop](https://intersect-training.org/workshop22/) held in August 2022 at Princeton University.

This repository builds a website that is live [here](https://intersect-training.org/packaging/).

You can build this website with the following commands if you use rbenv:

```bash
rbenv install 3.1.2  # Build Ruby 3.1.2 from source
rbenv local 3.1.2  # Use Ruby 3.1.2 in this folder
bundle install  # Install all the Ruby requirements for Jekyll
bundle exec jekyll serve  # build and serve the website
```
