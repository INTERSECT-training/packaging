Much research software is initially developed by hacking away in an interactive setting,
such as in a [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org) or a Python shell.
However, at some point when you have a more-complicated workflow that you want to repeat,
and/or make available to others,
it makes sense to package your functions into modules and ultimately a software package that can be installed.
This lesson will walk you through that process.

Consider the `rescale()` function written as an exercise in the Software Carpentry
[Programming with Python](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/08-func/index.html) lesson.

> ## Empty Repository
> Ensure you're in an empty git repository (see [Setup](../setup) for details).
{:.callout}

Create and activate your virtual environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
```

> ## Don't skip creating a virtual environment
> See [the episode on environments](../01-environment) for details.
{:.caution}

and install NumPy:
```bash
pip install numpy
```

Then, in a Python shell or Jupyter Notebook, declare the function:

```python
import numpy as np


def rescale(input_array):
    """Rescales an array from 0 to 1.

    Takes an array as input, and returns a corresponding array scaled so that 0
    corresponds to the minimum and 1 to the maximum value of the input array.
    """
    low = np.min(input_array)
    high = np.max(input_array)
    output_array = (input_array - low) / (high - low)
    return output_array
```

and call the function with:

```python
rescale(np.linspace(0, 100, 5))
```

which provides the output:

```
array([ 0.  ,  0.25,  0.5 ,  0.75,  1.  ])
```
{: .output}

## Create a minimal package

Let's create a Python package that contains this function.

Make sure you're in the empty repository created in [Setup](../setup).

Next, we want to create the necessary directory structure for your package.
This includes:
- a `src` ("source") directory, which will contain another directory called `package` for the source files of your package itself,
- a `tests` directory, which will hold tests for your package and its modules/functions,
- a `docs` directory, which will hold the files necessary for documenting your software package.

```bash
$ mkdir -p src/package tests docs
```

(The `-p` flag tells `mkdir` to create the `src` parent directory for `package`.)

> ## Directory Structure
> Putting the package directory and source code inside the `src` directory is not actually *required*.
> - If you put the `<package_name>` directory at the same level as `tests` and `docs` then you could actually import or call the package directory from that location.
> - However, this can cause several issues, such as running tests with the local version instead of the installed version.
> - In addition, this package structure matches that of compiled languages, and lets your package easily contain non-Python compiled code, if necessary.
{:.callout}

Inside `src/package`, create the files `__init__.py` and `rescale.py`:

- `__init__.py` is required to import this directory as a package, and should remain empty (for now).
  ```bash
  $ touch src/package/__init__.py
  ```
- `rescale.py` is the module inside this package that will contain the `rescale()` function;
  ```bash
  $ touch src/package/rescale.py
  ```

Copy the `rescale()` function into `rescale.py` file. (Don't forget the NumPy import!)

The last element your package needs is a `pyproject.toml` file. Create this with

```bash
$ touch pyproject.toml
```

and then provide the minimally required metadata, which include
- information about the package itself (`name`, `version` and `dependencies`) and
- build system (hatchling):

```toml
# contents of pyproject.toml

[build-system]
requires = ["hatchling"]
build-backend = "hatchling.build"

[project]
name = "package"
version = "0.1.0"
dependencies = [
  "numpy"
]
```

The package name given here, "package," matches the directory `package` that contains our project's code.
We've chosen 0.1.0 as the starting version for this package; you'll see more in a later episode about versioning,
and how to specify this without manually writing it here.

> ## Minimal Working Package
> The only elements of your package strictly _required_ to install and import it are
> the `pyproject.toml`, `__init__.py`, and `rescale.py` files.
{:.callout}

At this point, your package's file structure should look like this:

```bash
.
â”œâ”€â”€ docs/
â”œâ”€â”€ pyproject.toml
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ package/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ rescale.py
â”œâ”€â”€ tests/
â””â”€â”€ .venv/
```

## Installing and using your package

Now that your package has the necessary elements, you can install it into your virtual environment (which should already be active).
From the top level of your project's directory, enter

```bash
$ pip install --editable .
```

The `--editable` flag tells `pip` to install in editable mode, meaning that you can continue developing your package on your computer as you test it.

Then, in a Python shell or Jupyter Notebook, import your package and call the (single) function:

```python
import numpy as np
from package.rescale import rescale

rescale(np.linspace(0, 100, 5))
```

```
array([0.  , 0.25, 0.5 , 0.75, 1.  ])
```
{: .output}

This matches the output we expected based on our interactive testing above! ðŸ˜…

## Your first test

Now that we have installed our package and we have manually tested that it works,
let's set up this situation as a test that can be automatically run using `pytest`.

In the `tests` directory, create the `test_rescale.py` file:

```bash
touch tests/test_rescale.py
```

In this file, we need to import the package, and check that a call to the `rescale` function with our known input returns the expected output:
```python
# contents of tests/test_rescale.py
import numpy as np
from package.rescale import rescale


def test_rescale():
    np.testing.assert_allclose(
        rescale(np.linspace(0, 100, 5)),
        np.array([0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]),
    )
```

To use pytest to run this (and other tests), we need to install `pytest`. There are several ways to do that:
adding it as an optional dependency to the `pyproject.toml`, or adding it to the task runner.

Here we add it to the `pyproject.toml.file, by adding an extra block below the dependencies:
```toml
...
dependencies = [
  "numpy"
]

[project.optional-dependencies]
test = ["pytest"]

[build-system]
...

```

You install the project with the optional dependency using:
```bash
pip install --editable ".[test]"
```

You can run the tests using `pytest`:
```
(.venv) % pytest
======================== test session starts ========================
platform darwin -- Python 3.12.3, pytest-8.2.1, pluggy-1.5.0
rootdir: /Users/john/Developer/packaging-example
configfile: pyproject.toml
collected 1 item

tests/test_rescale.py .                                       [100%]

========================= 1 passed in 0.14s =========================
```

This tells us that the output of the test function matches the expected result, and therefore the test passes! ðŸŽ‰

## Publishing

The easiest way to make your code available for others is to commit it all
and push it to a public git repository.

> ## Don't `git commit -a` before you've set up your `.gitignore`
>
> When working with git, it's common to want to commit everything which has been changed
> using `git commit -a`.
> That's not a good idea here, because that will commit our virtual environment and its files
> which we don't want to do.
>
> - Until we have a `.gitignore` file, don't use `git commit -a`
> - Even when we do have a `.gitignore` file,
>   always check what you're committing using `git status`, before you do `git commit`
> - Better still use a graphical tool which makes it easy to see at a glance
>   what is is you're committing
>
{:.caution}

Commit the relevant files, first the code:

```bash
git add src/package/{__init__,rescale}.py
git add tests/test_rescale.py
git commit -m "feat: add basic rescaling function
```

... then the metadata:
```bash
git add pyproject.toml
git commit -m "chore: add minimal pyproject.toml"
```

... then push those to the `origin` remote repository.
```bash
git push origin main
```


> ## Check your package
> Check that you can install your package and that it works as expected.
>
> If everything works, you should be able to install your package (in a new virtual environment):
> ```
> python3 -m venv .venv2
> . .venv2/bin/activate
> python3 -m pip install git+https://github.com/<your github username>/packaging-example
> ```
> Open a python console and call the rescale function with some data.
{:.challenge}


Switch back to the original virtual environment before going onto the next lesson:
```
. .venv/bin/activate
```

You now have a package that is
- installed in editable mode in an isolated environment,
- can be interacted with in tests and in an interactive console,
- has a passing test, and
- is installable by anyone.

> ## Going further
>
> We selected a specific backend - hatching.
> It had a good default configuration, is fast, and has some powerful features and supports a growing ecosystem of plugins.
> There are other backends too, including ones for
> [compiled projects](https://learn.scientific-python.org/development/guides/packaging-compiled).
