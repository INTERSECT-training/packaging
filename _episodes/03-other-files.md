questions:
- "What other files are important parts of your software package?"
- "What software license should you use for your project?"
objectives:
- "Create a README for a software package"
- "Choose a software license for a software package"
- "Create a CHANGELOG for a package"
keypoints:
- "In addition to the source code and project specification, packages should include a README, LICENSE, and CHANGELOG."
- "Do not create a custom software license or modify an existing license; instead, choose from the list of available licenses."
- "You can also include `.gitignore` to avoid from committing non-source files and `.pre-commit-config.yaml` to automatically check simple issues with your code before committing it."

We now have an installed, working Python package that provides some functionality.
Are we ready to push the code to GitHub (or your preferred code hosting service) for others to use and contribute to?
ðŸ›‘ Not quiteâ€”we need to add a few more files at minimum to describe our package, and to actually make it open-source software.

Aside from the name of the package and docstring included with the (single) function, we haven't yet provided any description or other information about the package for anybody that comes across it.

We also haven't specified the terms and conditions under which the software may be downloaded, used, and/or modified.
This means that if we posted it online right now, due to copyright laws (in the United States, at least) nobody else would actually be able to use or modify the code, since we haven't given explicit permission to do so.

Lastly, as you continue working on your package, you will likely fix bugs and modify/add/remove functionality. Although these changes will *technically* be present in your Git logsâ€”because you are committing regularly and writing descriptive commit messages, right? ðŸ˜‰â€”you should also maintain a file that describes these changes in a human-readable way.

## Creating a README

A README is a plaintext file that sits at the top level of your package (next to the `src`, `tests`, `docs` directories and `pyproject.toml` file) and provides general information about your software.
Modern READMEs are typically written in Markdown, or occasionally reStructuredText (ReST), due to the additional formatting options that services like GitHub nicely render.

A README is a form of software documentation, and should contain at minimum:
 - the name of your software package
 - a brief description of what your software does or provides
 - installation instructions
 - a brief usage example
 - the type of software license (with more information in a separate `LICENSE` file, described next)

In addition, a README may also contain:
 - badges near the top that quickly show key information, such as the latest version, whether the tests are currently passing
 - information about how people can contribute to your package
 - a [code of conduct](https://www.contributor-covenant.org) for people interacting around your project (in GitHub Issues or Pull Requests, for example)
 - contact information for authors and/or maintainers

Create a README using

```bash
$ touch README.md
```

and then add these elements:

~~~markdown
# Package

`Package` is a simple Python library that contains a single function for rescaling arrays.

## Installation

Download the source code and use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install `package`:

```bash
pip install .
```

## Usage

```python
import numpy as np
from package.rescale import rescale

# rescales over 0 to 1
rescale(np.linspace(0, 100, 5))
```

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.

## License
TBD

## Choosing a software license

Now, your package includes a README file, which tells someone who finds the source code a bit about how to use your project and also contribute to it.
However, you still need one more element before uploading it to GitHub or another code-hosting service: a **software license** that explicitly gives specific permissions to users and contributors.
Simply making your project available publicly is not the same as making it an open-source software project.

By default, when you make a creative work such as software (but also including writing and images), your work is under exclusive copyright.
Others cannot use, copy, share/distribute, or modify your work without your permission.
This is often a good thing, because it means you can put your work out into the world, and copyright protects you as the creator and owner of the work.
Open Source Guides has more about the [legal side of open source software](https://opensource.guide/legal/).

However, if you have created research software and plan to share it openly, you *want* others to use your software, and possibly contribute to it. (Who doesn't love having other people fix the bugs in their code?)

A software license provides the explicit permissions for others to use, modify, or share your code, and lays out the specific rules for any restrictions about how they can do those things.
To pick a license, use resources like [Choose a License](https://choosealicense.com) or [Civic Commons "Choosing a License"](http://wiki.civiccommons.org/Choosing_a_License/) based on how you want others to interact with your software.
You can also see the [full list of open-source licenses](https://opensource.org/licenses/category) approved by the Open Source Initiative, which maintains the Open Source Definition.

For a new project, you essentially have one major choice to make:
 1. Do you want to allow others to use your software in almost any way they want, or
 2. Do you want to require others to share any uses of your project in an open way?

These two categories are "permissive" and "copyleft" licenses.
Common permissive licenses include the [MIT License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) and [BSD 3-Clause License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/bsd-3-clause/).
The [GNU General Public License v3.0 (or GNU GPLv3) License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/) is a common copyleft license.

Most research software uses permissive licenses like the [MIT License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/), [BSD 3-Clause License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/bsd-3-clause/), or the [Apache License 2.0](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/apache-2.0/).
For an easy choice, we recommend using the **BSD 3-Clause License**, which includes a specific clause preventing the names of creators/contributors from being used to endorse or promote derivatives, without permission.
However, you should choose the specific license that best fits your needs.
In addition, when working on a project with others or as part of a larger effort, you should check if your collaborators have already determined an appropriate license; for example, on work funded by a grant, a particular license may be mandated by the proposal/agreement.

Create a `LICENSE.txt` file using

```bash
$ touch LICENSE.txt
```

and copy the **exact** text of the [BSD 3-Clause License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/bsd-3-clause/), modifying only the year and names:

```

## Keeping a CHANGELOG

Over time, our package will likely evolve, whether through bug fixes, improvements, or
feature changes. For example, the `rescale` function in our package does not have a way
of properly treating cases where the max and min of the array are the same (i.e., when
the array holds the same number repeated). For example:

```python
import numpy as np
from package.rescale import rescale
a = 2 * np.ones(5)
rescale(a)
```

gives

```
rescale.py:11: RuntimeWarning: invalid value encountered in divide
  output_array = (input_array - L) / (H - L)
array([nan, nan, nan, nan, nan])
```
{: .output}

This is probably not the desired output; instead, let's say we want to rescale all the
values in this array to 1. We can modify the function to properly handle this situation:

```python
def rescale(input_array):
    """Rescales an array from 0 to 1.

    Takes an array as input, and returns a corresponding array scaled so that 0
    corresponds to the minimum and 1 to the maximum value of the input array.
    """
    L = np.min(input_array)
    H = np.max(input_array)
    if np.allclose(L, H):
        output_array = input_array / L
    else:
        output_array = (input_array - L) / (H - L)
    return output_array
```

Now, when we call rescale (no need to reinstall or upgrade the package, since we previously installed using editable mode):

```python
import numpy as np
from package.rescale import rescale
a = 2 * np.ones(5)
rescale(a)
```

we get the desired behavior:

```
array([1., 1., 1., 1., 1.])
```
{: .output}

Great! Let's commit that change using Git, with a message and perhaps update the version to 0.1.1 to
indicate the package has changed (more to come on that in a later episode on versioning).

That may be enough for us to record the change, but how will a user of your package know that the
functionality has changed? It's not exactly easy to hunt through Git logs and try to find which
commit message(s) align with the changes since the last version.

Instead, we can should [keep a changelog](https://keepachangelog.com) in a `CHANGELOG.md` file,
also at the top level of your package's directory. In this Markdown-formatted file, you should
record major changes to the package made since the last released version. Then, when you decide
to release a new version, you add a new section to the file above this list of changes.

Changes should be grouped together based on the type; suggestions for these come from the
[Keep a Changelog project](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) by
[Olivier Lacan](http://olivierlacan.com/):
 - `Added` for new features,
 - `Changed` for changes in existing functionality,
 - `Deprecated` for soon-to-be removed features,
 - `Removed` for now-removed features,
 - `Fixed` for any bug fixes, and
 - `Security` in case of vulnerabilities.

For example, our initial release was version 0.1.0, and we have now changed the functionality.
Our CHANGELOG should look something like:

```markdown
# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Unreleased
### Changed
- rescale function now scales constant arrays to 1

## [0.1.0] - 2022-08-09
### Added
- Created rescale() function and released package
```

If at this point you want to increment the version to 0.1.1 to indicate this small fix
to the behavior, you would add a new section for this version:

```markdown
## Unreleased

## [0.1.1] - 2022-08-10
### Changed
- rescale function now scales constant arrays to 1

## [0.1.0] - 2022-08-09
### Added
- Created rescale() function and released package
```

Note that the version numbers are shown as links in these examples, although the links
are not included in the file snippets. You should add definitions of these links
at the bottom of the file, using (for example) GitHub's ability to compare between
tagged versions:

```markdown
[0.1.1]: https://github.com/<username>/package/compare/v0.1.1...v0.1.0
```
